AOT PLATFORMS (eg iOS, xBox)
-------------------------------------------------------------
To make FlowCanvas work with these platforms, please open "Tools/ParadoxNotion/FlowCanvas/Preferred Types Editor".
Then press the "Generate AOTClasses and link.xml Files" button in there to automaticaly create the required files.
All *struct* types with which you are working with within FlowCanvas, should be in that list before generating the file.
You can of course re-generate the file any time you wish.


-------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATING
-------------------------------------------------------------
To update FlowCanvas you should preferrably:
- Backup your project.
- Remove previous FlowCanvas folder.
- Re-import FlowCanvas package anew.


-------------------------------------------------------------
USING WITH NODECANVAS
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you have both NodeCanvas and FlowCanvas in your project and considering you are getting a compile error, please do the following:
- Locate and delete the sub-folder named "Framework" either in 'NodeCanvas', or in 'FlowCanvas' main folder.
